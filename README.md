# Number_Calculator
25 years ago, a British computer magazine had a programming contest and this was one of the puzzles.

The first number is 123456789, the second is 123456798, the third is 123456879 and so on. 
No digit can repeat so 122345675 is not a valid number in this sequence.
The problem was "Write a program in that outputs the 100,000th number as fast as possible. 
Use any algorithm, except you cannot pre-calculate the answer and then write a program that just prints the result. 
Your entry must calculate the number!".
